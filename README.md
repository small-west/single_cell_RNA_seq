# single_cell_RNA_seq

## different pipline to deal with sc-RNA-seq data produced by different protocols

## samrt-seq 2
+ A sc-RNA-seq protocol for full length transcripts
+ LCM to isolate single cell and then samrt-seq2 to libarary preparing
+ smart-seq2 data preprocess pipline

## 10 x genomics
+ A sc-RNA-seq protocol for 3' end tanscripts
+ A divice for single cell isolation and library preparing at same time
+ 10 x genomics preprocess pipline
1. preprocess
2. R package Seurat grouping cell and annotation
